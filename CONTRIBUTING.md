# Contributing to Celeste Dashboard

:tada: Thank you for being interested in contributing to 1Hive! :tada:

Feel welcome and read the following sections in order to know how to ask questions and how to work on something.

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the project.

## Your first contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the Celeste Dashboard?

You can start with a [Good First Issue](https://github.com/1hive/celeste-dashboard/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

> Good first issues are usually for small features, additional tests, spelling / grammar fixes, formatting changes, or other clean up.

Start small, pick a subject you care about, are familiar with, or want to learn.

If you're not already familiar with git or Github, here are a couple of friendly tutorials: [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions), [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/), and [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).


## How to file an issue or report a bug

If you see a problem, you can report it in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/1hive/celeste-dashboard/issues).

Please take a quick look to see if the issue doesn't already exist before filing yours.

Do your best to include as many details as needed in order for someone else to fix the problem and resolve the issue.

#### If you're interested in the smart contracts underlying the 1hive Protocol, a [bug bounty program](https://wiki.1hive.org/community/swarms/bug-bounty) with payouts up to $40,000 in HNY is available for rewarding contributors who find security vulnerabilities.

## Fixing issues

1. [Find an issue](https://github.com/1hive/celeste-dashboard/issues) that you are interested in.
1. Fork and clone a local copy of the repository.
1. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
1. Push the changes to the remote repository.
1. Submit a pull request in Github, explaining any changes and further questions you may have.
1. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed.
1. Make changes to the pull request if the maintainer recommends them.
1. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!

It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is).
The reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!

You can also edit a page directly through your browser by clicking the "EDIT" link in the top-right corner of any page and then clicking the pencil icon in the github copy of the page.


### Styleguide and development processes

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to automatically lint and format the project.

We generally avoid adding external dependencies if they can be ported over easily, due to numerous NPM-related security issues in the past (e.g. [`event-stream`](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident)).

## Community
